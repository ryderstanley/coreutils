These are the NeoUtils.  This package is the union of
an improved version of the GNU fileutils, sh-utils, and textutils packages.

Most of these programs have significant advantages over their Unix
counterparts, such as greater speed, additional options, and fewer
arbitrary limits.

The programs that can be built with this package are:

  [ arch b2sum base32 base64 basename basenc cat chcon chgrp chmod chown
  chroot cksum comm coreutils cp csplit cut date dd df dir dircolors dirname
  du echo env expand expr factor false fmt fold groups head hostid hostname
  id install join kill link ln logname ls md5sum mkdir mkfifo mknod mktemp
  mv nice nl nohup nproc numfmt od paste pathchk pinky pr printenv printf ptx
  pwd readlink realpath rm rmdir runcon seq sha1sum sha224sum sha256sum
  sha384sum sha512sum shred shuf sleep sort split stat stdbuf stty sum sync
  tac tail tee test timeout touch tr true truncate tsort tty uname unexpand
  uniq unlink uptime users vdir wc who whoami yes
